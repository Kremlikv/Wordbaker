✅ Option 1: Use GitHub Actions + FTP Deploy to ByetHost
✔️ Pros:
Stay with ByetHost (you already like it)

Keep your current MySQL database

No switching hosts

Works with full PHP+SQL codebase

❗ Cons:
You still use FTP behind the scenes — but it’s automated from GitHub, so no manual uploads

🧩 Setup:
Add this to your GitHub repo as .github/workflows/deploy.yml:

yaml
Zkopírovat
Upravit
name: Deploy to ByetHost

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or master

jobs:
  ftp-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Upload to FTP
        uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4
        with:
          server: ftp.your-byethost-url.com
          username: your_byethost_ftp_user
          password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
          local-dir: ./
Go to your GitHub repo:

Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions

Add a secret called: FTP_PASSWORD

✅ Now every time you git push, it auto-deploys to ByetHost.
